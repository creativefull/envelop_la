                Dear Mr. [fname] [lname], 
                Do you own property that you would like to sell? Are you looking to sell quickly without having to pay a realtor a huge commission? If so please call me, as I am interested in purchasing your property for cash and with a quick closing if necessary. 

                Going through the process of selling a property can be extremely stressful especially when you have to spend large amounts of time on marketing, dealing with realtors and contract issues, meeting with buyers that arenâ€™t really serious about the property and just hoping that some offer might come through. When you consider the average number of days a property will sit on the market before it sells in this county is 150 days it may take even longer to sell your property depending on various factors. But I can provide you an immediate solution to these headaches. 

                My name is [myname] and I buy properties of all kinds throughout the area and I would be interested in speaking with you about the possible sale of your property. A brief phone conversation with me could save you a lot of time and energy while resulting in a fair offer for your house. 
                We have been working with sellers like you in the area for years and make the entire process very painless. 

                CALL US TODAY at 555-111-4444, and I will be happy to speak with you about the sale of your property. Of course everything is completely confidential and absolutely free. If you prefer, you can also fill out a form on our website www.sellhouseorhome.com. I look forward to working with you and I wish you and your family the very best during these difficult times. 
                Sincerely,
